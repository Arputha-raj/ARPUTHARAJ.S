# On a Journey from Learning to Impact

Hi, I’m Arputharaj!  
I’m still learning and growing as a data analyst — exploring tools like Power BI, Excel, and SQL to turn messy data into meaningful insights. I thrive on solving real-world problems, polishing my dashboards, and continuously improving my workflow.

This space is where I share my work, my progress, and a few experiments as I grow — from passion to profession.
